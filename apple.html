        <h1>Heuristicles and the Golden Apple</h1>
        When the goddesses Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena each claimed the golden apple, Heuristicles was asked to
        choose who should receive it. He chose the goddess with the potential to cause him the most harm. He reasoned
        that the great rewards offered by the goddesses would do little good if he was not alive to enjoy them. Thus,
        he chose Athena.
